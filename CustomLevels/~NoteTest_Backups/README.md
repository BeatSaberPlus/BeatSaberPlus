# **Do not play these maps!**

## These are backups of the **Debug** map NoteTest which shall **only** be used when trying to test plugins, see if your game is corrupted or doing a saber/note/wall showcase.
## This is not a map with audio nor is it a playable map as the NPS (Notes Per Second) is around about 0.12
## These backups can be deleted.
