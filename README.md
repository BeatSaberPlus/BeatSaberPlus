## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **A Windows PC that can run the Oculus or SteamVR Software aswell as Beat Saber and Beat Saber+**
- An Administrator account **might be** required for some features within some mods
- **Basic Knowledge about Beat Saber plugins and Custom Songs**

### Installation 
Beat Saber+ is here! Follow these steps to get started; **This method will include deleting your other plugins and songs. If you would like to keep them, please make a backup of the whole Beat Saber folder to a safe location on your PC**

- Scroll up and press the green "Code" button
- Press "Download ZIP"
- Extract the files to a folder on your PC **(DO NOT EXTRACT THESE IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR BEAT SABER FOLDER)**
- Enter your Beat Saber Directory and make sure you have BSIPA Installed correctly.
- Go into "Beat Saber_Data" and delete "CustomLevels"
- Go back to the Beat Saber Directory and delete the folder "Plugins"
- Put the folders "CustomAvatars", "CustomNotes", "CustomPlatforms", "CustomSabers" and "CustomWalls" into the Beat Saber Directory.
- Put the newly downloaded folder "Plugins" into the same directory as the one you deleted was in.
- Put the newly downloaded folder "CustomLevels" into the "Beat Saber_Data" directory.
- If you have one, delete the folder in the Beat Saber Directory called "Playlists"
- Put the newly downloaded folder "Playlists" into the Beat Saber Directory
- You should now be good to go!


**IMPORTANT:** NO DLC WILL COME BUNDLED WITH BEAT SABER+. ALL DLC MUST BE DOWNLOADED BY STEAM OR OCULUS AND WILL NEVER COME BUNDLED INSIDE A BEAT SABER+ DOWNLOAD. If a "Beat Saber+" Download contains a folder called "DLC", delete the full downloaded folder as it may contain a Malicious Plugin that can infect your PC. Always make sure to download Beat Saber+ from this page **ONLY**, or our [itch.io page](https://wasthathaze.itch.io/beatsaberplus)

Starting Beat Saber again can be done as normal.
