## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **A Windows PC that can run the Oculus or SteamVR Software aswell as Beat Saber and Beat Saber+**
- **Administrator account**
- **Basic Knowledge about Beat Saber plugins and Custom Songs**

### Installation 
You can now already join the Beta Testing Group without applying by following these steps; **This method will include deleting your other plugins and songs. If you would like to keep them, please make a backup of the whole Beat Saber folder to a safe location on your PC**

- Scroll up and press the green "Code" button
- Press "Download ZIP"
- Extract the files to a folder on your PC **(DO NOT EXTRACT THESE IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR BEAT SABER FOLDER)**
- Check what folders are in the downloaded ZIP (Might have to enter another folder as Windows's Extraction Procedure is a bit weird) and delete the corresponding folders in your Beat Saber folder.
- **Drag** the folders you just downloaded into the Beat Saber folder
- You should now be good to go!


Starting Beat Saber again can be done as normal.
