# Upgrade Policy

## Supported Versions

Beat Saber+ will support a Beat Saber version up until 2 further versions (excluding vX.X.1 for example) have been released from Beat Games.

The upgrade version schedule may look like this;

The current Version Upgrade Schedule looks like this;

This update schedule is for the **Main Repository Plugins**. You can still download an older version of Beat Saber+ with older mod versions. 
**Newer songs or packs added may not be backwards compatible. If you are planning to install Beat Saber+ in an installation older than 1.20,
please make sure no songs contain any Arcs or Chains.**

## Security Updates

Beat Saber+ Security Updates for Plugins are dependent on the Plugin Author. Beat Saber+ does not take any responsibility for Security Flaws in Plugins, 
however, we will temporarily remove Plugins with Security Flaws until the issue has been fixed.

**We advise you to check [this page](https://github.com/BeatSaberPlus/News/tree/main/Security) and select your year and find the latest post to see if there are 
any security flaws found in a plugin.**
